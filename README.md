# Customer-Classification
A machine learning project using k-means algorithm  which is applied 
to the target user prediction analysis of cloth purchase. Decision tree analysis 
algorithm are used to explore the characteristics of target groups in which 
purchase behavior will occur. The performance of algorithm for customer 
behavior prediction and the accuracy of prediction results are compared and 
analyzed, so that targeted services can be provided to satisfy the individual 
requirement of customers and improve customer satisfaction. Customer segmentation is mainly based on 
company history data. More specifically, data analysis is based on the frequency 
and preference of brand of each customer's past purchases which is 
retrieved from different data sets. Our results show that we can predict a 
customers purchase with high levels of accuracy, precision, and recall. We 
believe that this work impacts the customerâ€™s interest.
